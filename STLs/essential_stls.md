1. Containers:

- Vector: Dynamic array that allows fast random access and dynamic resizing.
- Deque: Double-ended queue that supports insertion and deletion at both ends.
- List: Doubly linked list for fast insertion and deletion at any position.
- Stack: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure.
- Queue: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure.
- Priority Queue: Queue where elements are dequeued based on priority.


2. Associative Containers:

- Set: Collection of unique elements sorted in a specific order (default is ascending).
- Map: Collection of key-value pairs sorted by key.
- Multiset: Set where multiple elements with the same value are allowed.
- Multimap: Map where multiple key-value pairs with the same key are allowed.

3. Unordered Containers (Hash-based):

- Unordered Set: Collection of unique elements, unordered with fast retrieval.
- Unordered Map: Collection of key-value pairs, unordered with fast retrieval.
- Unordered Multiset: Unordered Set where multiple elements with the same value are allowed.
- Unordered Multimap: Unordered Map where multiple key-value pairs with the same key are allowed.

4. Iterators:

- Input Iterators: Read-only iterators for sequential access to data.
- Output Iterators: Write-only iterators for sequential output of data.
- Forward Iterators: Bidirectional iterators supporting ++, --, and single-pass algorithms.
- Bidirectional Iterators: Forward iterators with backward traversal capabilities.
- Random Access Iterators: Bidirectional iterators with constant time access to any element.

5. Algorithms:

- Sorting: sort, stable_sort, partial_sort, nth_element.
- Searching: find, binary_search, lower_bound, upper_bound.
- Numeric Algorithms: accumulate, partial_sum, inner_product, adjacent_difference.
- Set Operations: merge, set_union, set_intersection, set_difference.
- Heap Operations: make_heap, push_heap, pop_heap, sort_heap.

5. Function Objects (Functors):

- Unary Function: Function object that takes one argument.
- Binary Function: Function object that takes two arguments.
- Adaptors: Function objects that modify or adapt other function objects.
